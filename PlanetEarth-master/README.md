PlanetEarth: Study Group Focus on Providing DeepLearning Solutions for bigger and real problems: ClimateChange, FoodSecurity, PlasticPollution, DeepFake, OceanicPollution, Industrial-Nuclear waste, CleanEnergy etc.

We are currently working with a project: "SmogDetection"; it's now started as a simple classification project which now consider images from two labels: "Smog/Fog/NotClearlyVisible Highways" and "Clearly visible Highways"
We welcome anyone like to contribute towards our dataset: simply upload Smog/Fog Covered images of Highways to "https://github.com/SayedMaheen/PlanetEarth/SmogDetection/Smog" and Highway images to "https://github.com/SayedMaheen/PlanetEarth/SmogDetection/Clear"
